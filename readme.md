#Simple Note taking App

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/andreiconstantinescu/notes-app.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A simple note taking app developed with a custom stack: [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [Jade](http://jade-lang.com), [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org) and [Bower](http://bower.io). In this stage is more like a todo list that uses localstorage for remembering your items. This app was developed just to play around with gulp and browserify and do something useful.
